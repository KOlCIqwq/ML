    "BoW and Tf-Idf are useful for topic detection, spam detection,... But when it comes to predict the next word they fail to capture the sentiment\n",

    "1. Assign each number a unique number to represent the word\n",
    "\n",
    "This will cause a fail prediction, we can have (happy = 1, bad = 30, good = 31), so good is closer to bad than happy, thus good = bad, which is not what we wanted\n",
    "\n",
    "2. One hot, represent each word as vector of 0, and mark 1 to the corresponding position. So it don't care the problem of assigning numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "This is eat up a lot of memory unecessary, because this vector could be very large (consider the BoW), and still fail to capture the context\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Word2Vec, suppose we have a vector of feature for certain word, then we can measure all other word in that vector\n",

    "E.g. bird = [animal,can_fly][1,1] fox = [animal,cannot_fly][1,0].\n",
    "\n",
    "So in the example we put the words into a 2D dimension, but this could easily take more than 2 dimensions.\n",

    "E.g. Beijing - China + Japan = Tokyo, why? Think Beijing as capital of China, then we toggle China and add Japan, becoming capital of Japan which is Tokyo"
